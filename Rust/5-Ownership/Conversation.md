In this code:
fn main() {
let n = Box::new([0; 1_000_000]);
let m = n;
}
the ownership of n is transfer for m, but the pointer of n still allocated in the stack until the escope of main end. Why? If the compile won't let me acess the pointee through n, why it doens't exclude the n from the stack after the move to m?
## Bing
The Rust compiler does not immediately deallocate n after ownership is transferred to m because of the way Rust handles stack memory. When a variable is declared in Rust, it is allocated a fixed amount of space on the stack. This space is reserved until the variable goes out of scope, regardless of whether the variable still owns any data.
In your code, n is a box pointer that owns a heap-allocated array. When you assign n to m, ownership of the array is transferred to m, but the space on the stack that was allocated for n when it was declared is still reserved. This is why n is still technically on the stack, even though it no longer owns any data.
The Rust compiler enforces these rules to prevent data races and ensure memory safety. By preventing access to n after ownership has been transferred, Rust ensures that there are no two mutable references to the same resource, which could lead to data races. By keeping n on the stack until it goes out of scope, Rust ensures that the memory it was using is properly deallocated, preventing memory leaks.
It's also worth noting that the cost of keeping n on the stack is relatively low, as stack memory is cheap and the size of a box pointer is small. The real memory consumption in your code is the heap-allocated array, which is properly managed through Rust's ownership system. When m goes out of scope, the array will be deallocated, freeing up the memory it was using on the heap.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. 游땕
## Usu치rio
It won't deallocete the n because of the way that the compile works (preventing data leak) or because this is a consequence of the way that the stack works with the memory?
## Bing
The reason n is not immediately deallocated after the ownership transfer is due to both the design of the Rust compiler and the nature of stack memory.
From the perspective of the Rust compiler, once a variable is declared, it exists until the end of its scope. This is a common behavior in many programming languages, not just Rust. The compiler's job is to translate your code into machine instructions that the CPU can understand, and it's easier and more efficient to allocate and deallocate memory in "blocks" (i.e., at the beginning and end of scopes) rather than constantly doing it whenever a variable is no longer needed.
From the perspective of how stack memory works, when a function is called, a block of memory is allocated on the stack for all of its local variables. This memory is automatically deallocated when the function returns. This is a very fast operation, but it's limited by the fact that it can only reclaim memory from the "top" of the stack (i.e., the most recently called function that hasn't yet returned). This is why stack memory is also called "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) memory.
So, in summary, n remains allocated on the stack after the move operation due to a combination of how the Rust compiler works (to ensure memory safety and prevent data races) and how stack memory is managed (using a LIFO approach for efficiency). The actual data n was owning (the heap-allocated array) is properly managed and will be deallocated when m goes out of scope, which is the important part for preventing memory leaks. 游땕
## Usu치rio
so even if Rust copiler didn't prioritize the memory safety and prevented data races, it wouldn't be possible to deallocate the n without deallocate the m?
## Bing
That's correct. Even if the Rust compiler didn't prioritize memory safety and preventing data races, it wouldn't be possible to deallocate n without deallocating m due to the nature of stack memory.
In a stack, memory is allocated and deallocated in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner. This means that the most recently allocated variable is the first one to be deallocated. In your code, m is allocated after n, so it would be deallocated first when the function scope ends. The stack memory for n can't be deallocated until all the variables allocated after it (like m) are deallocated.
This behavior is a fundamental aspect of how stack memory works and is not specific to Rust. It's part of what allows stack memory operations to be very fast, but it also means that manual deallocation of individual variables within a scope isn't possible. 游땕
## Usu치rio
if the stack works with LIFO memory, how does heap manage the allocation?
## Bing
Heap memory, unlike stack memory, does not follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Instead, heap memory is more flexible and allows for dynamic memory allocation. This means that variables can be allocated and deallocated in any order, regardless of when they were created.
When a variable is allocated on the heap, a certain amount of heap memory is reserved for it. The exact location of the variable in the heap is not known at compile time and is determined at runtime. A pointer to the variable's location in the heap is then stored in a fixed-size variable on the stack.
When the heap variable is no longer needed, it can be deallocated, freeing up the reserved memory for use by other parts of the program. This deallocation must be done manually, as the compiler does not automatically deallocate heap memory when a variable goes out of scope. This gives more control over memory management, but also places more responsibility on the programmer to avoid memory leaks.
In Rust, this manual deallocation is abstracted away by the ownership system. When a variable's ownership is dropped (either because it goes out of scope or because it is moved), Rust automatically deallocates the heap memory that the variable owned.
So, in summary, while stack memory is managed in a LIFO manner, heap memory allows for dynamic allocation and deallocation, giving more flexibility but also requiring careful management to avoid memory leaks. 游땕
## Usu치rio
but how does heap choose the space that the data will be allocated?
## Bing
The allocation of heap memory is managed by the operating system and the memory management unit (MMU) of the hardware. When a program requests a block of memory, the heap manager will choose a suitable block of memory to allocate.
The exact strategy for choosing a block can vary, but a common approach is the "first-fit" strategy, where the heap manager scans the heap from the beginning and chooses the first block that is large enough to satisfy the request. Other strategies include "best-fit", which finds the smallest block that is large enough; and "worst-fit", which finds the largest block.
The heap manager keeps track of allocated and free blocks, often using a data structure such as a linked list or a tree. When a block is allocated, it is removed from the list of free blocks. When a block is deallocated, it is added back to the list of free blocks.
It's important to note that the heap is a region of process's virtual memory, which is a space of addresses that the operating system makes available to a process. The operating system, with help from the MMU, maps these virtual addresses to physical addresses in the computer's RAM.
So, in summary, the choice of where to allocate heap memory is made by the heap manager, based on its allocation strategy and the state of the heap at the time of the request. 游땕

also, what is data races?
## Bing
Data races are a common problem in multithreaded programming. They occur when multiple tasks or threads access a shared resource without sufficient protections, leading to undefined or unpredictable behavior.
Let's consider a simple example. Suppose we have two tasks, Task1 and Task2, both of which write values to the same shared resources, sharedVar1 and sharedVar2. The tasks later read the values of the shared resources. Without any protection mechanisms, the value read may not be what you expect. This is because of the concurrent execution of Task1 and Task2, the shared resource sharedVar1 may be rewritten in Task2 before being read again in Task1.
Data races can be difficult to reproduce and fix because the execution of instructions does not follow the sequence in which the instructions are written. Also, the result can change in each test run.
To prevent data races, one common mechanism is to use mutual exclusion locks (Mutexes). A mutex ensures that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time, thus preventing data races. In Rust, the ownership system helps prevent data races by ensuring that only one variable can own a piece of data at a time. 游땕
